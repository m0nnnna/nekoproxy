1:
add email page to proxy 
button that will deploy postfix and the saslauth system
or postfix and rspamd to take mail and filter it to the mailcow system
the automated system will ask the user for mailcow ip and port 
once it connects to mailcow however is best it will ensure the following 
all outgoing email is stamped with the proxies IP address not the homeserver 
add a system where only users only named in a postfix file can send email from mailcow through the proxy using an address map 
this map will be editable in the webui via a "new user" and "remove user" button this will create a new mailbox in mailcow and add it to the proxies system 
also being able to add a blocklist for email only can be an address, an entire domain, or an ip/range
forwarding of normal ports can be done already in the proxy for login reasons 
deploying of the email proxy will have the same push to agents and allow the users to select what agent to deploy to

2:
geoip block system for both the normal ip blocklist and email blocklist 

3:
log search page allowing users to search through all the logs that are recorded logs are not wiped untill a user hits the button in the gui to wipe them out
